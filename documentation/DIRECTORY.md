# Prontus Directory Overview

This document provides an explanation of the key directories within a Prontus CMS installation: `cgi-bin`, `cgi-cpn`, and `noticias`. Each of these directories plays a specific role in the operation and customization of a Prontus-based website.

## 1. `cgi-bin`

The `cgi-bin` directory is crucial for the functionality of the Prontus CMS. It contains the main CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts, which are primarily written in Perl. These scripts are executed by the web server to perform various dynamic operations within the CMS.

### Purpose:
- **Core Scripts**: Includes essential scripts like `admin.cgi`, which is used for the Prontus administration interface.
- **Dynamic Processing**: Handles dynamic requests such as rendering articles, processing form submissions, and managing content.
- **Backend Operations**: Acts as the interface between the web server and the backend logic of the CMS.

### Examples:
- **`admin.cgi`**: The administration portal of Prontus.
- **`dispatcher.cgi`**: Manages the routing of requests within the CMS.

## 2. `cgi-cpn`

The `cgi-cpn` directory is used for custom scripts and modules that extend or complement the standard functionality of Prontus. These scripts are typically site-specific and are used to implement additional features or custom workflows that are not covered by the default Prontus installation.

### Purpose:
- **Custom Scripts**: Contains custom CGI scripts or Perl modules that provide additional functionality tailored to the specific needs of the site.
- **Modularity**: Allows developers to add new features without modifying the core Prontus scripts in `cgi-bin`.
- **Extensions**: Useful for adding widgets, custom content handlers, or integrating third-party services.

### Examples:
- **`custom_feature.cgi`**: A custom script to handle a specific feature required by the site.
- **`extra_module.pm`**: A Perl module that extends the functionality of the CMS.

## 3. `noticias`

The `noticias` directory is where content generated by users or administrators is stored. This includes articles, images, videos, and other types of media that are published on the website. The structure within this directory is often organized to manage different types of content effectively.

### Purpose:
- **Content Storage**: Stores the published content such as news articles, blog posts, and multimedia files.
- **Media Files**: Holds images, videos, and other media associated with articles.
- **Content Organization**: Typically organized into subdirectories for easy management of content categories or archives.

### Examples:
- **`2024/08/20/article123.html`**: An HTML file for a specific news article.
- **`images/logo.png`**: An image file used in articles or site templates.

## Summary

- **`cgi-bin`**: The core directory containing the essential CGI scripts for the operation of the Prontus CMS.
- **`cgi-cpn`**: A directory for custom scripts and extensions that enhance or modify the CMS functionality.
- **`noticias`**: The content repository where published articles, images, and other media are stored.

Understanding the purpose of these directories is essential for managing and customizing a Prontus-based website. Each directory has a distinct role that contributes to the overall functionality and flexibility of the CMS.
